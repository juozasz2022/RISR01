# RISR01

A project to extract data about registers and create a database using Neo4j.

## About The Project

This project is designed to extract data about registers. It utilizes a multi-language environment, including Python, JavaScript, and Julia, to process data and leverages the Neo4j graph database for storing and querying the extracted information.

*TODO: Add more details about the project's purpose, features, and the problem it solves. What kind of registers are being analyzed? What is the structure of the data?*

### Built With

*   [Python](https://www.python.org/)
*   [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
*   [Julia](https://julialang.org/)
*   [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/)

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

You will need to have the following installed on your system:

*   **Python:**
    *   Follow the instructions on the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
*   **Node.js (for JavaScript):**
    *   It is recommended to use a version manager like `nvm`.
    *   Follow the instructions on the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).
*   **Julia:**
    *   Follow the instructions on the [official Julia website](https://julialang.org/downloads/).
*   **Neo4j:**
    *   You can use Neo4j Desktop or set up a server.
    *   Follow the instructions on the [official Neo4j website](https://neo4j.com/download/).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repo:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/RISR01.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd RISR01
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    *   **Python:**
        *TODO: If you have a `requirements.txt` file, run:*
        ```sh
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
    *   **JavaScript:**
        *TODO: If you have a `package.json` file, run:*
        ```sh
        npm install
        ```
    *   **Julia:**
        *TODO: If you have a `Project.toml` file, you can instantiate the environment:*
        ```julia
        # From the Julia REPL
        using Pkg
        Pkg.activate(".")
        Pkg.instantiate()
        ```
4.  **Configure Neo4j:**
    *TODO: Provide instructions on how to configure the Neo4j connection, such as setting environment variables for the database URI, username, and password.*

## Usage

*TODO: Provide instructions and examples on how to run your project and use its features. Include code snippets, screenshots, or demos if applicable.*

For example, you might have a main script to run the entire data extraction and loading pipeline:
```sh
# Run the data extraction and database creation process
python main_pipeline.py
```

Or, you might have separate scripts for different parts:
```sh
# Run the JavaScript part
node js/script.js

# Run the Julia analysis
julia julia/analysis.jl
```

### Viewing the Interactive Website

This project includes a simple interactive website in the `website/` directory. To view it locally, you can run a simple web server from the root of the project.

1.  **Navigate to the project's root directory.**

2.  **Start a simple web server.** If you have Python 3, you can use the following command:
    ```sh
    python -m http.server
    ```
    If you have Python 2, use this command instead:
    ```sh
    python -m SimpleHTTPServer
    ```

3.  **Open your browser** and go to `http://localhost:8000/website/`. You should see the interactive website.
